        <h3>Welcome Page</h3>
        <p>
          The welcome page is the first thing a user seeing when opening the
          site. I created it using HTML tag "meta". The page is redirecting the
          user to the main page of the site after a specific time interval. In
          my case I set it to 4 second. CSS was used to style the loading screen
          and the background.

      <div class="storePage">
        <h3>The Store</h3>
        <p>
          The store is contained with 2 sub pages. Shop page and Checkout page.
          In the shop page I added all kinds of music instruments to be
          purchased. I designed the page using CSS. Here, Javascript was used to
          make the page functional. I created it in a way that the user could
          see what item they have added to the cart in a side bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Checkout page is where the user is provided with a form to get the
          billing details. Also all the items added to the cart in the previous
          page will be shown as a breakdown here. I used Javascript to validate
          all the user inputs in the form section.

        <h3>Pop Genre</h3>
        <p>
          This sub page has 4 sub topics. About pop, pop artists, pop songs, pop
          albums. I added background pictures and videos, hover effects, buttons
          using CSS. HTML was used to structure the web page as a grid.
